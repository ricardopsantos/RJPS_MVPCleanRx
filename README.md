# iOS Architecture design patterns : MVP/VIP + Clean + Rx

- [x] ðŸ“±  iOS 11.0+
- [x] ðŸ”¨  XCode 11.1, Swift 5.1

The intent of this project is to show a simple implementation of the __MVP/VIP Clean (Rx)__ pattern. This is my vision about it, and if you don't agree with something, just email me, I love to hear opinions and learn from that.

# Code Guidelines/Conventions

* All is private (variable, functions, etc), unless really need to be public
* The function where where set RxSuff will always be named  `rxSetup`
* The function where we setup the View layout will allways be named `prepareLayoutÂ´
* UIKit names
    * All UIButtons start by _btn_, example : _btnLogin_, _btnRegister_
    * All UILabel start by _lbl_. Example _llbName_, _lblPassword_
    * All UITableViews start by _table_ or _tbl_. Example : _tableUsers_, _tblFriends_
    * All UITextViews and UITextFields starts by _txt_. Example : _txtPassword_, _txtUserName_
    * Thumb rule : The name of the var, should be clear about the type associated.

The Unlicense is a template for disclaiming copyright monopoly interest in software you've written; in other words, it is a template for dedicating your software to the public domain.
