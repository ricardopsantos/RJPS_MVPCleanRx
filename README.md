# iOS Architecture design patterns : MVP/VIP + Clean + Rx

- [x] ðŸ“±  iOS 11.0+
- [x] ðŸ”¨  XCode 11.4, Swift 5.1

The intent of this project is to show a simple implementation of the __MVP/VIP Clean (Rx)__ pattern. This is my vision about it, and if you don't agree with something, just email me, I love to hear opinions and learn from that.

What is the Unlicensed?
The Unlicense is a template for disclaiming copyright monopoly interest in software you've written; in other words, it is a template for dedicating your software to the public domain. It combines a copyright waiver patterned after the very successful public domain SQLite project with the no-warranty statement from the widely-used MIT/X11 license.
