# iOS Architecture design patterns : (MVP or VIP) + Clean + Rx

- [x] ðŸ“±  iOS 11.0+
- [x] ðŸ”¨  XCode 11.4, Swift 5.1

The intent of this project is to show a simple implementation of the __MVP/VIP + Clean (Rx)__ pattern. This is my vision about it, and if you don't agree with something, just email me, I love to hear opinions and learn from that.

# Code Guidelines/Conventions

* All is private (variables, functions, etc), unless really need to be public.
* UIKit names
    * All `UIButton`s start by _btn_, example : _btnLogin_, _btnRegister_
    * All `UILabel`s start by _lbl_. Example _llbName_, _lblPassword_
    * All `UITableView`s start by _table_ or _tbl_. Example : _tableUsers_, _tblFriends_
    * All `UITextViews` and `UITextField`s starts by _txt_. Example : _txtPassword_, _txtUserName_
    * All Rx related vars start with `rx` or end with `Single`, `Observable`, etc...
    * Thumb rule : The name of the _var_, should be clear about the type associated.
