iOS Architecture design patterns : MVP + Clean + Rx
-----

- [x] ðŸ“±  iOS 10.0+
- [x] ðŸ”¨  XCode 1.2.1, Swift 5.0

The intent of this project is to show a simple implementation of the __MVP Clean__ pattern. This is my vision about it, and if you dont agree with someting, just email me, I love to hear opinions and learn from that.

What is the Unlicense?
The Unlicense is a template for disclaiming copyright monopoly interest in software you've written; in other words, it is a template for dedicating your software to the public domain. It combines a copyright waiver patterned after the very successful public domain SQLite project with the no-warranty statement from the widely-used MIT/X11 license.
